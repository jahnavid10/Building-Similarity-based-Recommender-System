# Building-Similarity-based-Recommender-System
Task 1: To understand what is collaborative filtering and how to collect data to build a recommendation system and load the required libraries and the dataset.                                                          
Task 2: To perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset to observe the user interactions with the item, for example, which item is the most interacted item and which user has interacted with most items etc.        
Task 3: To understand how to create a user-item matrix to start building the collaborative recommendation system.                                                                                                          
Task 4: To find which users are most similar to the other users from the user time matrix, this will help you recommend items to the users with the other similar users who have interacted.                                 
Task 5: To build a similarity-based recommendation system based on collaborative filtering.                                                                                                                             
Task 6: To understand different ways of building recommendation systems and how to recommend items to a new user who does not have interactions with the items.
